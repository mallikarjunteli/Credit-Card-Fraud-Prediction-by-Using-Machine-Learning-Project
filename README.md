# Credit-Card-Fraud-Prediction-by-Using-Machine-Learning-Project
Data Science Project

Objective: The goal is to build a model that can predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
Dataset: You'd need a dataset containing historical credit card transactions labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent.
Data Preprocessing:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the characteristics of the data, distribution, and potential patterns.
Handling Missing Data: Address any missing values in the dataset.
Feature Scaling: Ensure that all features are on a similar scale to prevent one feature from dominating others.
Feature Engineering:

Selecting Relevant Features: Identify and select features that contribute significantly to the prediction task.
Creating New Features: Generate new features if needed, like transaction frequency, time of day, etc.
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Logistic Regression Model:

Introduction: Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm suitable for predicting the probability of an event (fraud or not fraud).
Model Training: Use the training data to train the logistic regression model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune parameters like the learning rate and regularization strength for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Confusion Matrix: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The confusion matrix provides a clear picture of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Handling Imbalanced Data:

Dealing with Skewed Classes: In credit card fraud detection, the number of legitimate transactions is often much higher than fraudulent ones. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using synthetic data can address this imbalance.
